# home-base
Home-Base is intended to be my personal project portfolio so that I can show off to my family and friends (and employers). 
I'm making it as both a way to organize my progress as an engineer and a way for me to learn the basics of wab development. 
My sources of information are the tutorials on MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) and the occasional help from AI chatrooms when I am stuck.
I am aware that just doing this is far from fully understanding web development, and I'm certain that there are many ways to improve the webpage. However, I am satisfied with leaving it as it is for the time being.
